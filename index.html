            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I am a creative and aspiring Front End Developer who loves learning and technology. In 2018, I received my 
            <strong>Bachelor of Science Degree from Florida International University.</strong> My interest in Web Development began with 
            trying to teach my students lessons in fun and interesting ways. I created websites and interactive games 
            using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as engagement for my middle school students. At night, I would generate new 
            designs to test out on the students in the morning. Through this, I found my love in the world of Web Development
            and a hunger to learn more everyday.
